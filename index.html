			Hello, my name is Brandon Rivard and this is my last year being at UNO. If all goes as planned I should be graduated by the end of 2024
			Growing up I've always been interested in computers mostly from the gaming aspect. As a kid I would go as far as to say that I was
			addicted to being on the computer and learning more about them. I've always been interested in technology and innovation so it only
			made sense to go back to school to grow my knowledge on computers. Which is why I chose Computer Science as my major. With that, I've 
			had the opportunity to take a few ISQA classes and they've all been interesting and incorporated hands on development.
			I hope this class falls in line and has more opportunities for hands on development.
